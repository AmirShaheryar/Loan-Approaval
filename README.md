# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction – Elevvo Internship Project 4

This project was developed during my internship at **Elevvo** as part of a real-world machine learning challenge. The goal was to predict loan approval outcomes based on applicant data using classification models.

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval is a critical decision-making process in the financial sector. This project uses historical loan data to train models that can predict whether a loan should be approved or not.

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

## ⚙️ Techniques & Tools

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values
- Class Balancing using **SMOTE**
- Model Evaluation: **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**
- Python Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## 📊 Results

Both models were evaluated and compared using classification metrics. SMOTE significantly improved performance on imbalanced data.
